Contributions are always welcome!

You can help us add more functions that can be useful for developers. Visit this project's [Github Repository](https://github.com/Zerapium/js-helpertools) and start a PR.

While adding more functions to this package try to - 
 - Not include any dependancy unless it's necessary
 - Make a clean code
 - Check the code for errors before submitting a PR
 - Add comments wherever necessary to explain whats happening
 - Drink caffeine that helps us keep up the good work ;)
